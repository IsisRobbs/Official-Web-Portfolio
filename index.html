        <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>
       I am a Jr. Web Developer who is obssesd with learning code and creating aesthically pleasing content! 
       Web development is a very new skill of that I have been able to develop over the last few months.
       I find that my love for problem solving allows me to not only grow as a developer but enjoy the issues we 
       need to resolve as programmers. Being a developer has also made it possible to show my creativity with designing 
       web pages and understand how to build projects that are appealing to various audiences.<br>I will showcase these new found 
       skills in these projects I have created during my learning journey.
