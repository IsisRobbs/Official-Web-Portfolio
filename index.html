        <h1>About Me</h1>
       <p>
       I am a Jr. Web Developer who in love with learning code and creating aesthically pleasing content! 
       Web development is a very new skill of that I have been able to develop over the last few months.
       I find that my love for problem solving allows me to not only grow as a developer but enjoy the issues we 
       need to resolve as programmers. Being a developer has also made it possible to show my creativity with designing 
       web pages and understand how to build projects that are appealing to various audiences.<br>I will showcase these new found 
       skills in these projects I have created during my learning journey.

            <p class="card-text">This project had me use HTML with a framework for the first time.
                 I had created a resume and got to play with building the format of my page.
                I had some difficulties with aligning my card with the rest of my content and 
                I came up with this final look that was able to complete my requirements.
                 I learned that I needed to practice more with grids and flexbox to help creeate pages 
                that aere more symmetrical.</p>
